# To Do List

1. fix the add bricks button

2. start working on linking the shopping cart to the bricks added

3. add more bricks

4. set a limit so not all are loaded onto page at the same time

5. stop from being able to add decimals

6. dummy id's needs to be in local storage too so it keeps the ting after refreshing

7. checkout.js needs to be simplified

## questions

* only 10 bricks should be loaded at a time
* references of where i got the bricks from
* only one media query
* create server folder
* redirect is a bad idea
