# To Do List

1. fix the add bricks button

2. start working on linking the shopping cart to the bricks added

3. add more bricks

4. set a limit so not all are loaded onto page at the same time

5. stop from being able to add decimals

6. dummy id's needs to be in local storage too so it keeps the ting after refreshing

## questions

* change setAttribute functions
* consistency with casing and naming
* no adding decimals
* going to cart only possible if there is something in local storage
* cart, login and logout button should stay on page as user scrolls
* only 10 bricks should be loaded at a time
* style goodbye message after the click so setAttribute isn't used there
* references of where i got the bricks from
