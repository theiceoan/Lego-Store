6. references of where i got the bricks from

7. only one media query

8. multiple folders within client folder

## questions

* only 10 bricks should be loaded at a time
* create server folder


use e.target.closest('.brick').querySelector('.error');
edit an api and add a parameter that specifies how many can be added
return all the bricks to client, and specify how many you want

point out that using id's of incrementing numbers at the beginning was weak however from that point on, you were going to use uuid
